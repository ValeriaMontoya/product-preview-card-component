## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I implemented the use of rem instead of pixels to define the font sizes. Here's an example of it:

```css
p:first-of-type {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  font-weight: 500;
  line-height: normal;
  letter-spacing: 5px;
  padding-block-end: 12px;
}
```
